Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

} ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events.

If `immediate` is true, the delay can be disregarded and the operation can be immediately executed, otherwise the operation can be executed if and only if delay is greater than 0. NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument. In that case they will fail to identify the indirect workflow, and will consider calls that require a delay to be forbidden. NOTE: This function does not report the permissions of this manager itself. These are defined by the {_canCallSelf} function instead.\"},\"cancel(address,address,bytes)\":{\"details\":\"Cancel a scheduled (delayed) operation. Returns the nonce that identifies the previously scheduled operation that is cancelled. Requirements: - the caller must be the proposer, a guardian of the targeted function, or a global admin Emits a {OperationCanceled} event.\"},\"consumeScheduledOp(address,bytes)\":{\"details\":\"Consume a scheduled operation targeting the caller. If such an operation exists, mark it as consumed (emit an {OperationExecuted} event and clean the state). Otherwise, throw an error. This is useful for contract that want to enforce that calls targeting them were scheduled on the manager, with all the verifications that it implies. Emit a {OperationExecuted} event.\"},\"execute(address,bytes)\":{\"details\":\"Execute a function that is delay restricted, provided it was properly scheduled beforehand, or the execution delay is 0. Returns the nonce that identifies the previously scheduled operation that is executed, or 0 if the operation wasn't previously scheduled (if the caller doesn't have an execution delay). Emits an {OperationExecuted} event only if the call was scheduled and delayed.\"},\"expiration()\":{\"details\":\"Expiration delay for scheduled proposals. Defaults to 1 week. IMPORTANT: Avoid overriding the expiration with 0. Otherwise every contract proposal will be expired immediately, disabling any scheduling usage.\"},\"getAccess(uint64,address)\":{\"details\":\"Get the access details for a given account for a given role. These details include the timepoint at which membership becomes active, and the delay applied to all operation by this user that requires this permission level. Returns: [0] Timestamp at which the account membership becomes valid. 0 means role is not granted. [1] Current execution delay for the account. [2] Pending execution delay for the account. [3] Timestamp at which the pending execution delay will become active. 0 means no delay update is scheduled.\"},\"getNonce(bytes32)\":{\"details\":\"Return the nonce for the latest scheduled operation with a given id. Returns 0 if the operation has never been scheduled.\"},\"getRoleAdmin(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Get the id of the role that acts as an admin for the given role. The admin permission is required to grant the role, revoke the role and update the execution delay to execute an operation that is restricted to this role.\"},\"getRoleGrantDelay(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Get the role current grant delay. Its value may change at any point without an event emitted following a call to {setGrantDelay}. Changes to this value, including effect timepoint are notified in advance by the {RoleGrantDelayChanged} event.\"},\"getRoleGuardian(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Get the role that acts as a guardian for a given role. The guardian permission allows canceling operations that have been scheduled under the role.\"},\"getSchedule(bytes32)\":{\"details\":\"Return the timepoint at which a scheduled operation will be ready for execution. This returns 0 if the operation is not yet scheduled, has expired, was executed, or was canceled.\"},\"getTargetAdminDelay(address)\":{\"details\":\"Get the admin delay for a target contract. Changes to contract configuration are subject to this delay.\"},\"getTargetFunctionRole(address,bytes4)\":{\"details\":\"Get the role required to call a function.\"},\"grantRole(uint64,address,uint32)\":{\"details\":\"Add `account` to `roleId`, or change its execution delay. This gives the account the authorization to call any function that is restricted to this role. An optional execution delay (in seconds) can be set. If that delay is non 0, the user is required to schedule any operation that is restricted to members of this role. The user will only be able to execute the operation after the delay has passed, before it has expired. During this period, admin and guardians can cancel the operation (see {cancel}). If the account has already been granted this role, the execution delay will be updated. This update is not immediate and follows the delay rules. For example, if a user currently has a delay of 3 hours, and this is called to reduce that delay to 1 hour, the new delay will take some time to take effect, enforcing that any operation executed in the 3 hours that follows this update was indeed scheduled before this update. Requirements: - the caller must be an admin for the role (see {getRoleAdmin}) - granted role must not be the `PUBLIC_ROLE` Emits a {RoleGranted} event.\"},\"hasRole(uint64,address)\":{\"details\":\"Check if a given account currently has the permission level corresponding to a given role.

It can be increased without setback (and reset via {revokeRole} in the case event of an accidental increase). Defaults to 5 days.\"},\"renounceRole(uint64,address)\":{\"details\":\"Renounce role permissions for the calling account with immediate effect. If the sender is not in the role this call has no effect. Requirements: - the caller must be `callerConfirmation`. Emits a {RoleRevoked} event if the account had the role.\"},\"revokeRole(uint64,address)\":{\"details\":\"Remove an account from a role, with immediate effect. If the account does not have the role, this call has no effect. Requirements: - the caller must be an admin for the role (see {getRoleAdmin}) - revoked role must not be the `PUBLIC_ROLE` Emits a {RoleRevoked} event if the account had the role.\"},\"schedule(address,bytes,uint48)\":{\"details\":\"Schedule a delayed operation for future execution, and return the operation identifier. It is possible to choose the timestamp at which the operation becomes executable as long as it satisfies the execution delays required for the caller. The special value zero will automatically set the earliest possible time. Returns the `operationId` that was scheduled. Since this value is a hash of the parameters, it can reoccur when the same parameters are used; if this is relevant, the returned `nonce` can be used to uniquely identify this scheduled operation from other occurrences of the same `operationId` in invocations of {execute} and {cancel}. Emits a {OperationScheduled} event. NOTE: It is not possible to concurrently schedule more than one operation with the same `target` and `data`. If this is necessary, a random byte can be appended to `data` to act as a salt that will be ignored by the target contract if it is using standard Solidity ABI encoding.\"},\"setGrantDelay(uint64,uint32)\":{\"details\":\"Update the delay for granting a `roleId`.
